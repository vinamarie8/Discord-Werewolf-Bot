Permissions
- Restrict certain commands to be certain role only

New commands
- Scott's Stats!!! -- !stats pgp_patron_name - Bot reads it from JSON file
- Custom poll with custom reacts -- !pollReacts question|choice a:react a|choice b:react b

!wheel

!vote
- Timer - messages results after timer runs out :o (Set a max) - display countdown, stop it prematurely?
-? Allow only one reaction per user? (could affect performance)
-? Graphical representation of votes? (could affect performance)
-? Only mentioned role members can vote? (sorry ghosties, could also affect performance)

!votePlayers
-? maybe automate noms for dwwvd??? -- (if timer gets interrupted, it could break)

!votenames or !votenoms -- Use names instead of mentioning players
- Format either:
    - same as custom poll but it will add peace (no kill) react: 
        !votenames vote_message|name 1|name 2|name 3
        !pollnames vote_message|name 1|name 2|name 3
    - similar to !votePlayers but with pipe to separate optional message:
        !votenames name1 name2 name3|optional_message

Other
-? dm help
-? help just gives list of commands and says to ask help for specific command

Nonsense fun stuff
